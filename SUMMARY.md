**Concrete Crack Segmentation Dataset** (Concrete Crack Segmentation Dataset) is a dataset for semantic segmentation tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains.

The dataset consists of 446 images with 980 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*crack*).

Each image in the Concrete Crack Segmentation Dataset dataset has pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 0 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (446 images). The dataset was released in 2022.

Here is the visualized example of the single *crack* class:
