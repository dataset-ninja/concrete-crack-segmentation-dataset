**Concrete Crack Segmentation Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the construction industry. The dataset presented here is not the original one. Learn more on the dataset's homepage.

The dataset consists of 458 images with 1010 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*crack*).

Images in the Concrete Crack Segmentation dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2019 by the Orta Dogu Teknik Universitesi.
