**Concrete crack** (Concrete crack Segmentation Dataset) is a dataset for semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the industrial industry.

The dataset consists of 446 images with 980 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*crack*).

Each image in the Concrete crack dataset has pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (446 images). The dataset was released in 2022.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
