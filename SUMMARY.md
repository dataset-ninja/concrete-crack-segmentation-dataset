**Concrete crack Segmentation Dataset** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the industrial industry.

The dataset consists of 446 images with 1089 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*crack*).

Images in the Concrete Crack Segmentation dataset has pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (446 images). The dataset was released in 2022.
