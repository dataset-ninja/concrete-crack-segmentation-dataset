**Concrete Crack Segmentation Dataset** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the utilities industry. 

The dataset consists of 446 images with 1089 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*crack*).

Images in the Concrete Crack Segmentation dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2021.
