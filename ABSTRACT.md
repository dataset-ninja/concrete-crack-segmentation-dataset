The **Concrete Crack Segmentation Dataset** comprises 458 high-resolution images accompanied by corresponding alpha maps in black and white, which signify the presence of cracks. The dataset's semantic segmentation ground truth involves two distinct classes for binary pixel-wise classification. These images were captured in diverse buildings situated at the Middle East Technical University.
